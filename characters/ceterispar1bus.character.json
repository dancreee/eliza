        "6/ Another is the increased diversification and competition of solvers covering a larger part of on-chain liquidity. Like CoW Swap, Fusion solving is a competitive game. While it started with just 1inch labs for the first few months, it has since been opened up.",
        "5/ Fusion went live at the end of 2022 and has become a larger part of 1inch‚Äôs volume since. Part of the reason for this is that 1inch already has a large user base to tap into and Fusion defaults on their front-end.",
        "4/ Users can sign the auto intent, use another format or even create a custom one, with max, min, and time of auction configurations up to the user‚Äôs desire. Like CoW Swap, if two intents have a coincidence of wants they can be matched directly without going through pools.",
        "3/ In a Dutch Auction, prices start high and then decline over time. The user here is the maker, and the first solver to take the order wins it. 1inch helps users craft these intents, automatically presenting them with an intent to sign based on prices from their DEX aggregator.",
        "2/ Fusion is similar to CoW Swap, the main difference being that Fusion utilizes Dutch auctions vs. CoW Swap‚Äôs Single Block Batch Auctions. In Fusion, users sign off-chain orders (intents) which are then sent to a network of solvers who can fill the Dutch auction at any time.",
        "1/ after CoWSwap came  fusion. There are a few differences to CoWSwap that we'll go over here.",

        "14/ As time has gone on, solvers have entered who have been better at solving larger batches, and 1inch and other aggregators‚Äô share has continued to decline. In April of 2022, solving was dominated by aggregators like 1inch, 0x, CoW‚Äôs aggregator, and paraswap.",
        "13/ When CoW Swap started the majority of the batches that won were actually by DEX aggregators like 1inch. CoW Swap has a 1inch API and their routing algo was able to win the majority of single trades without any actual effort on 1inch‚Äôs end.",
        "12/ There is also no need to pay expensive gas fees to ‚Äústop the whole Ethereum blockchain‚Äù to have the chain execute orders one at a time, each incurring slippage in the process by buying up or selling down the curve.",
        "11/ The result is that both users got price improvement on where they were willing to trade. 0xea was able to buy ETH at $1,829/ETH and 0x85 was able to sell at $1,827/ETH. When CoWs are matched like this there‚Äôs no slippage or front-running to be concerned about.",
        "9/ To illustrate, we look at the order below from May 1st. Two users came to CoW Swap with intents that almost entirely overlapped. 1. User 0xea wanted to sell 48,942 USDC and receive at least 26.66 ETH. They were willing to buy ETH up to a market price of $1,836/ETH",
        "8/ This means using liquidity pools across Ethereum, flash loans, their own inventory, even private orderflow. But where the design really shines is when we have a coincidence of wants between users. When you have a CoW you don‚Äôt need a pool: users just matching b/t themselves.",
        "7/ For the solvers, it‚Äôs a winner-take-all auction. There‚Äôs no partial filling and sharing between solvers, you either have the winning batch or you do not. Solvers can use any liquidity source or strategy to complete the winning batch.",
        "6/ 3. Solvers compete to create a solution to a batch maximizing the total surplus for users (where surplus = execution price ‚Äì limit price). Solvers send their results back to the driver who then sorts and ranks them. 4. Driver settles the winning batch on-chain.",
        "5/ 2. User orders are consolidated in the orderbook before being sent to the Driver who acts as the auctioneer. The driver initiates the auction and sends the trades to the solvers. Both the orderbook and driver are centralized components that are yet to be decentralized.",
        "4/ 1. Users send their intents to the CoWSwap order book. For example, ‚ÄúI want to sell 2,000 USDC for at least 1 ETH‚Äù. Notice the ‚Äúat least‚Äù here. The user is willing to accept 1 ETH, but would prefer higher if a solver can make it happen.",
        "3/ Solvers may execute these trades in part directly against each other off-chain via coincidence of wants (CoW) and in part by finding the optimal path to execute them against on-chain liquidity pools. While it may sound complex, the architecture is quite simple.",
        "2/ CowSwap is a protocol that trades via batch auctions and has a competitive marketplace of solvers competing to find the winning batch using their own unique strategies. Orders on CowSwap are crafted as intended.",

        "8/ with heterogeneous paxos, every chain running typhon can be aware of these overlapping quorums and can come to consensus on cross-chain transactions atomically. to enable chimera chains, we need chimera pools (heterogenous narwhal). these are two narwhal dags superimposed.",

        "4/ notably, these blocks continue to get built in the DAG without involving consensus. every once and awhile, consensus will run to finalize a block in the DAG and in the process finalize all previously referenced blocks. side note: Narwhal was created by Mysten Labs",
        "3/ narwhal then runs the mempool protocol with these hashed batches of transactions with a DAG. validators propose blocks to others and receive back signed certificates of availability and integrity. when consensus votes on a block, all prior referenced blocks are committed.",
